# PongGame

I created this game based on a Video from WebDevSimplied on Youtube. <br>
I love his channel and after watching the video I wanted to try it by myself, especially because there is a beautiful colour change during the game.

I deployed to the GitHub Pages, [come play!](https://liaximenes.github.io/PongGame/)  🏓
